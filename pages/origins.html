    <h1>The Origins of Modern Israel</h1>

      <h2>A Long-Awaited Return</h2>
      <p>
        After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, the Jewish people
        were scattered around the world. Yet for over 1,800 years, the dream of
        returning to their ancestral homeland remained strong. Prayers, songs,
        and traditions kept the hope alive — always ending with the phrase:
        “Next year in Jerusalem.” In the late 1800s, amid rising antisemitism in
        Europe, a modern movement emerged: Zionism. Led by thinkers like Theodor
        Herzl, Zionism called for a Jewish state in the land of Israel (then
        part of the Ottoman Empire). The first waves of immigrants began
        arriving, building communities and reclaiming land.

      <p>
        The term "Aliyah" means "ascent" in Hebrew. It reflects not just a
        physical journey, but a spiritual and national rise — returning to Zion,
        the ancient homeland of the Jewish people.
