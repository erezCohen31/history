      <h1>The Legacy of Israel Today</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Israel’s legacy reaches far beyond its borders. As a modern state
          built on ancient dreams, its influence is seen in technology, culture,
          science, humanitarian aid, and global Jewish identity. What was once a
          fragile hope has become a vibrant and complex society — still
          evolving, still inspiring.

        <h2>Innovation Nation</h2>
        <p>
          Israel is now known worldwide for its innovation. Often called the
          “Start-Up Nation,” it has more tech startups per capita than any other
          country. From medical devices to water technology, Israeli
          breakthroughs impact millions globally.

        <h2>Culture and Identity</h2>
        <p>
          Israel is a melting pot of Jewish cultures — from Yemenite music to
          Moroccan food to Russian literature. Hebrew has been revived as a
          modern language spoken in schools, songs, and science.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “We are not a melting pot, but a mosaic.” – President Reuven Rivlin

        <h2>Memory and Education</h2>
        <p>
          Israel plays a key role in Holocaust education and remembrance through
          Yad Vashem and global programs like March of the Living. Schools and
          military units often visit memorials to connect history with identity.
