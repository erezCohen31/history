        <h2>The Declaration of Independence (1948)</h2>
        <p>
          The original Declaration of the State of Israel was signed on May 14,
          1948, in Tel Aviv. It is preserved today in the Israel State Archives.
          The scroll lays out the vision for a Jewish democratic state and
          refers to biblical ties, Holocaust survival, and international
          recognition.
        </p>

          Herzl’s original diary and personal letters are kept at the Central
          Zionist Archives. They reflect his evolving ideas, political fears,
          and international efforts to gain support for a Jewish homeland. These
          documents reveal the human side of a visionary leader.

          <summary>What’s inside the diary?</summary>
          <p>
            Plans for the First Zionist Congress, ideas for the flag, and a
            draft of The Jewish State can be found inside Herzl’s notebook.

        <h2>Early Kibbutz Tools</h2>
        <p>
          Farming tools used by pioneers in early kibbutzim show how idealism
          met reality. Shovels, hand-plows, and journals tell stories of
          physical labor and cooperation. Many of these items are displayed in
          the Kibbutz Yad Tabenkin Museum.
        </p>

          <summary>Kibbutz Life</summary>
          <p>
            Each member of a kibbutz shared the work, food, and resources. Early
            settlers worked 10–12 hours a day building not just farms, but
            entire communities.
