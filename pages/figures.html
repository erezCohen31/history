        <p>
          Theodor Herzl (1860–1904) is widely regarded as the visionary who
          transformed the dream of a Jewish homeland into a political movement.
          A journalist from Austria-Hungary, Herzl organized the First Zionist
          Congress in 1897, advocating for the establishment of a Jewish state
          in Palestine. His book, Der Judenstaat ("The Jewish State"), inspired
          many to support the Zionist cause.

          David Ben-Gurion (1886–1973) was the primary national founder and the
          first Prime Minister of Israel. He proclaimed the establishment of the
          State of Israel on May 14, 1948, and led the country during its early,
          turbulent years. Ben-Gurion focused on building the country’s
          institutions and absorbing waves of immigrants.
